# jxkel-s-midi-pack
This is version 1 of the midi packs that I have been collecting/making for the last 8 days.(11/28)
Total Count of MIDI's(estimate): 145-190
I will release v1.1 of the midi pack and maybe a sheet music pack a week after I release this MIDI pack.
Discord : jxkel#2653
If there are any issues with the MIDI's, contact the discord listed above.
Current Version: v1.0
If someone releases my pack without my permission, contact me.
Anyways,have fun with the MIDI's I have given to you!
I will make a private version consisting of way better MIDI's costing 1-2$ instead of the musicnote midi"s costing 4.99$ and above.
The download link will always come from my discord(jxkel#2653) as listed above and my github link(here)
